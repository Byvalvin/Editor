# Editor

“ed” is a line-oriented editor for text. It was developed in the late 1960s as part of the creation of the  UNIX computer operating system. (Linux is the popular open-source descendent of UNIX.) 

This is an ed-like editor. The commands are based on those of ed but have been  simplified both in terms of the number of commands supported and the complexity of the commands.  Nonetheless, this is a functional text editor that can be used to both create new textfiles and edit existing ones.
